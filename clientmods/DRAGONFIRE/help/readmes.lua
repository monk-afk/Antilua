# autocraft

Automated crafting GUI that fills the craft grid from inventory and repeatedly crafts items. Recipes are auto-detected when you arrange items on the grid and are persisted via `core.settings`.

## Player usage

**Chat commands:**

- `/autocraft` — Opens the autocraft GUI with a 3×3 craft grid, inventory, and toggle button.
- `/autocraft_list` — Shows all known recipes in a list; click a recipe to select/deselect it.
- `/autocraft_clear` — Clears all stored recipes.

**Cheat:** `Autocraft` (category: Player) — Toggles the `autocraft` setting.

**Recipe persistence:** Recipes survive restarts via `core.settings:get/set("autocraft_recipes")` as JSON.

**Behavior:** While the cheat is on and a recipe is selected, the mod polls the craft grid every 0.3 s: takes the result, refills ingredients from the main inventory, and re-crafts. If ingredients run out, it pauses and reports.

## API

None.

# autoeat

Automatically eats food when the player's hunger drops below a configurable threshold. Integrates with the `autodupe` mod when only one food type is available.

## Player usage

**Cheat:** `AutoEat` (category: Player) — Toggles auto-eating via the `autoeat` setting.

**Settings:**

- `autoeat` (bool) — Master toggle.
- `autoeat_cooldown` (number, default 0.5) — Minimum seconds between eats.
- `autoeat_hunger` (number, default 9) — Hunger threshold; eat when below this value. The mod reads the `hbhunger_icon.png` HUD element to determine current hunger (falls back to 20 if not found).

## API

All exported on the global `autoeat` table.

- `autoeat.lock` (bool) — Lock flag; when `true` the globalstep skips eating. Set by the autodupe integration.
- `autoeat.eat()` — Finds the first food item in the main inventory, wields it, and activates it. If only one food type is present and `autodupe` exists, delegates to `autodupe.needed()` instead.
- `autoeat.get_hunger()` → number — Returns the player's current hunger level by reading the hunger HUD element (or 20 as fallback).

# autoevade

Teleports the player a random horizontal distance when a projectile (arrow, splash potion, or shulker bullet) comes within trigger range.

## Player usage

**Cheat:** `AutoEvade` (category: Combat) — Registered via `ws.rg()` with the `autoevade` setting.

**Settings:**

- `autoevade.scan_range` (number, default 4, min 1, max 20) — Radius for scanning nearby objects for projectiles.

**Behavior:** On each global step, scans nearby objects for projectile textures (`arrow_box`, `_splash`, `shulkerbullet.png`). If a projectile with non-zero velocity is within trigger distance, the player is teleported to a random offset position (Y=2, X/Z in ±evade_distance).

# nlist

Named, persistent node/item list manager. Provides a UI and chat commands to
create, edit, select, and persist named lists of itemstrings. Integrates with
other mods: lists can be imported into chat commands that expose a
`list_setting` field.

## Player usage

### Chat commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/nls <list>` | Select a list by name |
| `/nlshow` | Show current list content as HUD |
| `/nlhide` | Hide the list HUD |
| `/nla [item]` | Add item to selected list (or switch to add mode) |
| `/nlr [item]` | Remove item from selected list (or switch to remove mode) |
| `/nlc` | Clear all items from selected list |
| `/nlawi` | Add wielded itemstring to selected list |
| `/nlrwi` | Remove wielded itemstring from selected list |
| `/nlapn` | Add pointed node's itemstring to selected list |
| `/nlrpn` | Remove pointed node's itemstring from selected list |

### Cheats

| Cheat | Setting | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| NlEdMode | `nlist_edmode` | Shows list HUD; punching a node adds/removes it from the selected list |

NlEdMode provides a custom settings formspec with a textlist showing all
entries, dropdown to select lists, and buttons to create/delete lists or
add/remove entries.

### Integration with other mods

Chat commands that define `list_setting` on their registration are extended
with an `nls` argument. Running `.<command> nls` copies the currently selected
nlist into that command's setting. For example:

```
/xray nls   -- imports current nlist entries into xray's node list
```

## API

### Global

`nlist` — main namespace table.

`nlist.set(list, tb)` — replace list contents with `tb` (array of strings). If the list
name matches a `list_setting` on a registered chat command, the value is stored
as a minetest setting; otherwise it uses mod storage.

`nlist.get(list)` — return array of itemstrings for the named list, or `{}`.

`nlist.clear(list)` — empty the named list.

`nlist.delete(list)` — empty the named list (same as clear).

# sbots

Simple bot library. Provides a framework for creating autonomous bots that fly
to positions and perform actions. Includes one built-in bot (`listDigBot`) when
the `nlist` mod is present. Bots are activated/deactivated via the cheat menu.

No direct player-facing chat commands — bots are registered by other mods and
toggled through the cheat system.

## Player usage

### Cheats

| Cheat | Setting | Category | Description |
|-------|---------|----------|-------------|
| listDigBot | `listDigBot` | Bots | Finds and digs nodes from the currently selected nlist |

Additional bots registered by other mods (e.g. SpongeBot in the `place` mod)
appear under the Bots category.

### Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `listDigBot.allow_cobot` | bool | false | Allow running alongside other bots |

## API

### Global

`sbots` — main namespace table.

### Functions

`sbots.register_bot(name, def)` — register a new bot. The bot appears as a
cheat under the Bots category with setting name equal to `name`. If another bot
is already active and `allow_cobot` is false, activation is rejected.

### Bot definition

```lua
{
    -- Callbacks (all optional, defaults provided for each):

    find_pos = function(self, pos) end,
    -- Called in stage 0 to find a target position. Return a position vector
    -- or nil/false. pos is the player's current position. When nil is returned
    -- and stand_waiting is false, the bot deactivates itself.

    do_pos = function(self, pos) end,
    -- Called when the bot reaches its target (stage 2). Return true to signal
    -- completion and move to stage 0 (find next target).

    do_step = function(self, dtime) end,
    -- Called every globalstep while the bot is active, regardless of stage.

    update_pos = function(self, pos) return self:find_pos(self, pos) end,
    -- Called every globalstep when moving_target is true to update the
    -- target position mid-flight. Defaults to re-running find_pos.

    on_activate = function(self) end,
    -- Called when the bot is activated. Return true to abort activation.

    on_deactivate = function(self) end,
    -- Called when the bot is deactivated.

    -- Properties:

    landing_distance = 1,
    -- Distance from target at which the bot stops flying and enters stage 2.

    moving_target = false,
    -- Whether the target can move; enables update_pos every tick.

    stand_waiting = false,
    -- If true, the bot stays active even when find_pos returns nil.

    daughters = {},
    -- Sub-settings to toggle with this bot.

    delay = nil,
    -- Override the default hack delay.

    allow_cobot = false,
    -- Set to true in the def to allow concurrent bot operation.

    -- Internal (set at runtime):

    active = false,
    orig_pos = nil,
    target_pos = nil,
    stage = 0,
}
```

### Bot lifecycle

1. **Stage 0**: Calls `find_pos`. If a position is returned, sets `target_pos`
   and transitions to stage 1. If nil and `stand_waiting` is false, deactivates.
2. **Stage 1**: Aims at `target_pos` and enables forward movement. When within
   `landing_distance`, transitions to stage 2.
3. **Stage 2**: Disables forward movement, calls `do_pos`. If `do_pos` returns
   true, transitions back to stage 0.
4. Every tick: calls `do_step`. If `moving_target`, calls `update_pos`.

### Built-in: listDigBot

Registered if `nlist` is available. Finds the closest node from nlist's
selected list within 60m, flies to it, and digs all matching nodes within 1m.

## Cheats

None directly. Bot framework — bots are registered by other mods via sbots.register_bot().
